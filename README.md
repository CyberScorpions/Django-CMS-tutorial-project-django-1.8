# Django-CMS-tutorial-project-django-1.8-
Hi,
i made it while studying the tutorial,
might come handy to you if you are a newbie.

I do not guarantee that everything is working well,
but overall it's fine.

be aware the right now the tutorial has few issues with django 1.8, you
can see more details here:
